# BRAND & MESSAGING GUIDELINES - SAMPLIT

## 🎯 BRAND POSITIONING

### One-Line Positioning:
**"Adaptive A/B testing that learns and optimizes automatically"**

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds):
```
Samplit is A/B testing that actually works.

Unlike traditional tools that split traffic 50/50 and waste 
weeks waiting for results, Samplit uses adaptive algorithms 
to automatically reduce traffic to losing variants.

Result: Faster decisions, less wasted traffic, better ROI.

We use it ourselves to optimize Samplit. That's how much 
we trust it.
```

### Extended Pitch (2 minutes):
```
Most A/B testing tools waste your traffic.

Here's the problem: Traditional A/B testing divides traffic 
50/50 between variants and keeps that split fixed for weeks. 
During that entire time, 50% of your visitors see the losing 
variant.

If you have 10,000 visitors and spend 3 weeks testing, that's 
15,000 visitors wasted on a variant you'll eventually discard.

Samplit solves this.

We use adaptive algorithms that learn in real-time which 
variant performs better and progressively reduce traffic 
to underperformers.

You get:
- Results in days, not weeks
- Less traffic wasted on losers
- Same statistical rigor

We're not another expensive enterprise tool with 500 features 
you'll never use. We're focused on doing one thing exceptionally 
well: helping you find winning variants faster.

And we eat our own dog food. Every email, landing page, and 
feature we ship is tested using Samplit. We show our real 
results on our blog.

That's Samplit.

## 💬 COMPETITOR MENTION POLICY

### ✅ DO:
- Acknowledge competitors exist
- Be respectful and honest
- Point out real differences
- Recommend competitors when they're better fit

### ❌ DON'T:
- Trash competitors
- Make up false claims
- Fear-monger about their limitations
- Steal their messaging

**Example good comparison:**
```
"Optimizely is a powerful enterprise platform with features 
like personalization, feature flags, and experimentation. 
It's great for large companies with complex needs.

Samplit is simpler and more affordable. We focus on doing 
A/B testing really well. 

If you're a small-to-medium business, Samplit is likely 
a better fit. If you're enterprise with $50k+ budget and 
need the full suite, Optimizely makes sense."

Just crossed $5k MRR! 🎉

Took 8 months from launch. Not overnight success, but 
sustainable growth.

What worked:
- SEO (blog posts with real data)
- Dogfooding (we test our own stuff)
- Transparency (sharing wins AND losses)

What didn't:
- Paid ads (burnt $2k, got nothing)
- "Growth hacks" (waste of time)

Slow and steady.
```

```
Failed test of the week:

Redesigned our pricing page. Hired designer, looked 
beautiful. Spent €2,400.

Result: -18% conversion 😅

Lesson: Pretty ≠ effective. Users want clarity, not 
gradients.

Back to the "ugly" version. Conversions are happy.
