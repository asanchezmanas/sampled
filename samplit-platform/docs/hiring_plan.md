## 💡 HIRING TIPS (España específico)

### Legal Considerations:

**Contractor vs Employee:**
- **Autónomo (contractor):** Más flexible, menos protección
- **Indefinido (employee):** Más seguridad, employer costs +30%
- **Temporary contract:** Bridge before indefinido

**First 2-3 hires:** Consider autónomo (prueba)
**After product-market fit:** Transition to indefinido

---

### Where to Post Jobs:

**España:**
- **LinkedIn** (primary)
- **InfoJobs** (traditional)
- **Manfred** (tech roles)
- **Domestic** (startups)
- **RemoteOK** (remote)
- **Slack communities** (MadridJS, BarcelonaJS, etc.)

**Free:**
- Twitter (your network)
- LinkedIn personal post
- Startup newsletters (ThinkSaaS, etc.)

---

### Salary Negotiation:

**When they ask "What's the salary?"**

**Early in process:**
*"We're budgeting €X-Y for this role, depending on experience. 
What range are you targeting?"*

**If they lowball:**
*"That's below our range. We value this role at €X-Y because 
[reasons]. Does that work for you?"*

**If they're high:**
*"That's above our current budget. We're at €X-Y, plus equity 
and growth opportunity. Would you consider that?"*

**Always leave room for negotiation (10-15%).**

## 🎯 WHEN NOT TO HIRE

### Don't hire if:

❌ **Can't afford 12+ months runway**
Hiring is expensive. Don't hire if cash tight.

❌ **Role not clear**
Define role before hiring. What will they do day 1?

❌ **You can still do it**
If founder can handle workload, wait.

❌ **Product-market fit not validated**
Fix PMF before scaling team.

❌ **Just because you raised money**
Money ≠ permission to hire. Hire only when needed.

---

## 💰 HIRING BUDGET (Example)

### Year 1 (€200k raised):

```
Founder salary:        €40k   (20% of budget)
Hire #1 (CS):          €35k   (Month 3-12 = €29k)
Hire #2 (Sales):       €50k   (Month 5-12 = €33k OTE)
Recruiting costs:      €5k    (ads, tools)
Equipment:             €3k    (laptops, etc.)
Total people:          €100k  (50% of budget)

Remaining:
Product dev:           €50k
Marketing:             €30k
Ops/misc:              €20k
```

---

### Year 2 (€500k raised):

```
Team (8 people):       €350k  (70% of budget)
Recruiting:            €20k
Product/infra:         €60k
Marketing:             €50k
Ops:                   €20k
```

**People costs grow from 50% → 70% of budget as you scale.**

---

## 🎓 CULTURE & VALUES

### Define Early:

**Your values:** (examples)
1. **Customer obsession** - Customers come first
2. **Radical transparency** - Open, honest, direct
3. **Build with excellence** - Quality over speed
4. **Ownership mindset** - Everyone is a founder

**Hire for values fit. Skills can be taught.**

---

### Culture Red Flags:

❌ **Avoid:**
- "We're a family" (no, you're a team)
- "Work hard, play hard" (burnout culture)
- "Rockstars only" (ego problem)
- Unlimited PTO (often means no PTO)

✅ **Better:**
- Clear expectations
- Sustainable pace
- Results > hours
- Real work-life balance

---

## 📋 FIRING (Yes, It Happens)

### When to Fire:

**Performance Issues:**
- Not meeting goals (after coaching)
- Can't learn/improve
- Wrong fit for role

**Cultural Issues:**
- Toxic behavior
- Values misalignment
- Damaging team

**Business Issues:**
- Role no longer needed
- Company downsizing

---

### How to Fire (España):

**Process:**
1. Document issues (written warnings)
2. Improvement plan (30-60 days)
3. If no improvement → termination
4. Severance (required by law)
5. Exit interview

**Legal:**
- **Despido objetivo:** Justified (incompetence, etc.)
- **Despido disciplinario:** Serious misconduct
- **Despido improcedente:** No cause (most expensive)

**Get legal advice. Spanish labor law is complex.**

---

### Severance (approximate):

- **Indefinido:** 20 days per year worked
- **Temporal:** Usually none (unless early termination)
- **Trial period (3-6 months):** No severance

**Budget for this. It's expensive.**
