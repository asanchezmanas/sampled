# PUBLIC ROADMAP - SAMPLIT

## 🎯 ROADMAP PHILOSOPHY

### Why Public Roadmap:

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Transparency builds trust
- ✅ Gets customer feedback early
- ✅ Manages expectations
- ✅ Shows you're actively building
- ✅ Differentiator (most hide roadmap)

**Risks:**
- ❌ Competitors see your plans
- ❌ Pressure to deliver on timeline
- ❌ Customers wait for features

**Balance:** Share direction, not detailed specs or dates.

---

### What to Include:

✅ **Share:**
- High-level features
- "Now, Next, Later" buckets
- Why you're building it
- General timeframe (Q1, Q2, not specific dates)

❌ **Don't Share:**
- Exact implementation details
- Technical architecture
- Proprietary algorithms
- Firm deadlines
- Everything you're considering

---

## 📊 ROADMAP STRUCTURE

**NOW (Shipping this quarter):**
- In active development

- ~3 months

**NEXT (Planned for next quarter):**
- Validated with customers
- Medium confidence
- 3-6 months

**LATER (On our radar):**

## 🎯 ROADMAP PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK

### RICE Score:

**R**each: How many users affected?
**I**mpact: How much does it help?
**C**onfidence: How sure are we?
**E**ffort: How long to build?

**Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort**

---

### Example:

**Feature: Server-Side Testing**

- Reach: 50% of users (score: 50)
- Impact: High - solves major pain (score: 3)
- Confidence: 80% (score: 0.8)
- Effort: 3 months (score: 3)

**RICE = (50 × 3 × 0.8) / 3 = 40**

---

**Feature: Dark Mode**

- Reach: 100% of users (score: 100)
- Impact: Low - nice to have (score: 1)
- Confidence: 100% (score: 1)
- Effort: 1 week (score: 0.25)

**RICE = (100 × 1 × 1) / 0.25 = 400**

**Higher score = Higher priority**

---

### Other Factors:

Beyond RICE, consider:
- Strategic alignment
- Competitive necessity
- Technical dependencies
- Customer urgency
- Market timing

---

## 📢 COMMUNICATING DELAYS

### If Feature Delayed:

**Be Transparent:**

**Roadmap Update:**
```
Server-Side Testing
Status: 🟡 Delayed
Original ETA: Q2 2025
New ETA: Q3 2025

Why: Prioritized Shopify app based on customer 
feedback. Server-side is still coming, just 
pushed back one quarter.

Sorry for the delay! We'll keep you updated.
```

---

**Email to Waiting Customers:**
```
Subject: Update on Server-Side Testing

Hi [name],

I know you're waiting for server-side testing.

Update: We've pushed it from Q2 to Q3 2025.

Why: We heard from 50+ Shopify customers that 
native app is more urgent. We're shipping that 
first (April).

Server-side testing is definitely still coming. 
We haven't forgotten about you!

Timeline:
- April: Shopify app ships
- May: Server-side development starts  
- July: Server-side beta

Thanks for your patience.

PS: If this is a blocker for you, let me know. 
We might be able to prioritize or find a workaround.

## 🚫 WHAT NOT TO PUT ON ROADMAP

### Keep Private:

❌ **Core Algorithm Changes**
Competitive advantage. Don't telegraph.

❌ **Pricing Changes**
Announce when ready, not before.

❌ **Partnerships**
Until signed, don't mention.

❌ **Acquisition/Funding Plans**
Confidential business decisions.

❌ **Experiments You're Running**
Internal tests, not product features.

---

## 📊 ROADMAP METRICS

### Track:

**Engagement:**
- Pageviews on roadmap
- Time on page
- Feature votes
- Comments on items

**Feature Adoption:**
- % using new features within 30 days
- Retention impact
- Support tickets (decrease?)

**Customer Satisfaction:**
- NPS change after shipping
- Survey: "Are we building what you need?"
- Churn reasons (missing features?)

---

## 🎓 LEARNING FROM ROADMAP

### Quarterly Review:

**Questions:**
1. What did we ship on time?
2. What got delayed? Why?
3. What did we cancel? Why?
4. What surprised us (usage, feedback)?
5. What should we adjust?

**Adjust roadmap based on learnings.**

## 💬 SAMPLE FAQ

### "Can I influence the roadmap?"

*"Absolutely! Submit feature requests on our board: [link]. We review every submission and prioritize based on votes and strategic fit. Many features on our roadmap came directly from customer feedback."*

---

### "Why isn't [feature] on the roadmap?"

**Answer:**
*"We might be considering it but not committed yet. Or it might not align with our current focus. Submit it as a feature request and we'll evaluate!"*

---

### "When will [feature] ship?"

**Answer:**
*"Our ETAs are estimates, not commitments. We prioritize quality over speed. If a feature is 'Now', expect it within 3 months. 'Next' = 3-6 months. 'Later' = 6-12+ months. Things can shift based on complexity or priority changes."*

---

### "Will you build [competitive feature]?"

**Answer:**
*"We're focused on doing A/B testing exceptionally well. Some features (like heatmaps) are better handled by specialized tools. We'd rather integrate than build a mediocre version."*

---
