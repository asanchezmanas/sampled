## 🎯 DECK STRUCTURE

### SLIDE 1: COVER

**Visual:** 
- Samplit logo
- Clean, simple background

**Text:**
```
SAMPLIT
A/B Testing That Adapts Automatically

[Your Name]
Founder
[Date]
```

**Note:** Keep it minimal. First impression matters.

---

### SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

**Headline:**
**"Traditional A/B Testing Wastes Traffic"**

**Visual:**
- Chart showing 50/50 split
- Traffic going to losing variant (red)
- Wasted opportunity highlighted

**Text:**
```
In traditional A/B testing:

• 50/50 traffic split stays fixed
• Losing variant gets traffic for WEEKS
• You wait for "statistical significance"

Result: 50% of visitors see the worse experience
```

**Example Calculation:**
```
10,000 visitors/month
× 3 weeks testing
× 50% to loser
= 15,000 wasted visits
```

**Speaker notes:**
*"Imagine running a test for 3 weeks. During that entire time, half your traffic sees the worse version. That's thousands of potential customers seeing a suboptimal experience."*

---

### SLIDE 3: THE COST

**Headline:**
**"This Has Real Business Impact"**

**Visual:**
- Calculator-style breakdown
- Dollar signs, lost revenue

**Text:**
```
Real Example:

10,000 monthly visitors
3% conversion rate = 300 conversions
50% to losing variant = 150 lost conversions
Average order value: €100

Lost revenue: €15,000/month
```

**Different example for SaaS:**
```
5,000 visitors to pricing page
2% signup rate = 100 signups
50% see worse variant = 50 lost signups
LTV: €500

Lost value: €25,000
```

**Speaker notes:**
*"And this is just ONE test. Multiply this across multiple tests over a year..."*

---

### SLIDE 4: THE SAMPLIT SOLUTION

**Headline:**
**"Adaptive Testing That Learns in Real-Time"**

**Visual:**
- Animated diagram (if presenting live)
- Or: Before/After comparison
  - Before: 50/50 fixed
  - After: Adaptive allocation

**Text:**
```
Samplit automatically:

✓ Identifies winning variants faster
✓ Reduces traffic to losers progressively
✓ Maximizes conversions while testing

Same statistical rigor, better efficiency
```

**Visual example:**
```
Day 1:  [A: 50%] [B: 50%]
Day 3:  [A: 40%] [B: 60%] ← B performing better
Day 5:  [A: 25%] [B: 75%] ← More traffic to winner
Day 7:  [A: 10%] [B: 90%] ← Converged
```

**Speaker notes:**
*"Instead of wasting traffic on the loser, Samplit learns which variant works and sends more traffic there - while still gathering enough data for statistical confidence."*

---

[Show comparison slide]

---

### "We don't have much traffic"

**Response:**
*"How many visitors per month to the page you'd test? [Answer] With that traffic, you'd see results in about [X days]. Traditional testing would take [Y weeks]. Still faster, plus you're not wasting half your traffic."*

*"That's great! What do you like about it? [Listen] And what would you change if you could? [Listen]"*

Then address their pain points with Samplit benefits.

---

---

### "How do I know it works?"

**Response:**
*"Two things: First, we use it ourselves. [Show your results] Second, 14-day trial - you can validate with your own tests before paying anything."*
